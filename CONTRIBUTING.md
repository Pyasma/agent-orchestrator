## Before you start

Read these first:

1. **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** - repo layout, daemon/API boundaries, coding conventions, and hard rules. Required reading before writing code.
2. **[Development Guide](docs/development.md)** - prerequisites, build steps, running tests, and troubleshooting.

## Picking an issue

[Browse open issues](https://github.com/AgentWrapper/agent-orchestrator/issues).

- **`good first issue`** - small, well-scoped, good for new contributors
- **`help wanted`** - the team would appreciate community help
- **No assignee** - check if someone is already working on it

If you want to work on something not in the issues, open a feature request
first to get feedback.

## Project structure at a glance

```
backend/          # Go daemon - Cobra CLI, HTTP API, services, SQLite storage
frontend/         # Electron + React desktop app (TypeScript)
packages/
  mobile/         # React Native (Expo) mobile companion
  ao/             # Legacy npm CLI (frozen, no longer updated)
docs/             # Architecture, status, CLI docs, ADRs
```

### Where to find things

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| CLI commands | `backend/internal/cli/*.go` |
| HTTP controllers | `backend/internal/httpd/controllers/` |
| Service/business logic | `backend/internal/service/` |
| Domain types | `backend/internal/domain/` |
| Port interfaces | `backend/internal/ports/` |
| SQLite schema & queries | `backend/internal/storage/sqlite/` |
| Generated SQL code | `backend/internal/storage/sqlite/gen/` (do not edit) |
| API DTOs | `backend/internal/httpd/controllers/dto.go` |
| OpenAPI spec generation | `backend/internal/httpd/apispec/` |
| Frontend renderer | `frontend/src/` |
| Frontend e2e tests | `frontend/e2e/` |

## Pull request checklist

Before submitting, make sure:

- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (backend lint + tests)
- [ ] `npm run frontend:typecheck` passes (frontend type check)
- [ ] New code has tests covering the happy path, validation errors, and
      daemon error envelopes
- [ ] API changes include regenerated spec and schema.ts (`npm run api`)
- [ ] No generated files (sqlc gen, OpenAPI) are hand-edited
- [ ] The PR targets `main` and follows conventional commits

## Testing philosophy

- Backend tests use `httptest`, fakes, and injected dependencies - no real
  daemon needed.
- Write tests at the user-visible boundary: CLI output, HTTP responses, session
  state transitions.
- Don't add network calls to tests unless the package already uses integration
  tests.
- Frontend tests use Vitest (unit) and Playwright (e2e).
